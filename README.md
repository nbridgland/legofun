# legofun

Do whatever you want with this repository, it's just for learning.
The data is all available on kaggle.  Search for "lego database".
Our initial idea is to try to predict what theme a lego set is from based on 
the colors of the pieces

The single file I've uploaded so far is a jupyter notebook - download anaconda
to be able to work with those.  They're really terrible for merging on git, so
if you want to write something for other people to use, it's best to upload 
.py files. That's also why I've called it scratchwork - I'll try to get my 
useful stuff into scripts when I can.
